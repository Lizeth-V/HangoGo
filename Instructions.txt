Webapp should be functional and running at https://letshangogo.com
If not email aidanmara@gmail.com

If you would like to run it on your own server:

    1.Download all the files into your environment.

    2.Install all packages located in the requirements.txt file.
        -Run "pip install -r requirements.txt" in your environment
        -In the worst case that the flask app does not run, recreate the environment and install the packages python says are missing.

    3.Add an environment file (.env) to the main directory
        -*IMPORTANT* The contents of the .env file should be replaced with the text found in the env.txt file.

    4.In your environment run "python.exe app.py"

    5.Explore the webapp.
